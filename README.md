# Classical Music Quiz
This is the toy app for the Media Playback lesson of the Advanced Android App Development course on Udacity.

## Overview

Classical Music Quiz utilizes the _ExoPlayer_ library to randomly play ten pieces of classical music. As each piece is played, the user is given four possible composers to select as the composer of the currently playing piece. As a selection is made, the selections are colored either green for correct or red for incorrect. A score of correct answers is kept and used to determine a high score over multiple plays.
